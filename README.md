Waypoint is an atmospheric puzzle game made by 10 students from the University of Toronto and Centennial College for the "Introduction To Game Design Course" and later showcased at the 9nth Annual Levelup Toronto.


In Waypoint, the objective of each level is to guide and safegaurd an npc character known as "the traveller" through the winding paths and dangerous obstacles of a dark forest. Using light to attract it's attention to different positions (the titulur waypoints) player must be wary of attracting lurking monsters with that same light. As the game progresses, the player unlocks more abilities such as lights that can be used to distract monsters, lights that can only be seen by the traveller, as well as a stun ability that can slow monsters down. Puzzles/levels are designed as "open puzzles" where players are able to use their toolkit of abilities to express themselves and to create their own solutions. The player must juggle between their different abilities, the amount of resources they have for them, the layout of the map, as well as the positions of all characters on it.
